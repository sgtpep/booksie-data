> Readers won't find any offensive or inappropriate content on this site, and it may get kids interested in geography, vocabulary, and other subjects. Users don't have to register or download anything to use Booksie, and they'll find dozens of reading options that can be accessed immediately — including a number of books that feature positive themes, such as being brave and trying new things. . . . The site reportedly has more than a thousand stories for beginning and other readers from about a dozen outlets that focus on objectives like improving literacy, gender equality, and character-building. Individual story topics range from woodland creatures to a girl's first day of school and protecting marine life. Kids can flip through pages of each story and use functionality that randomly selects and open a book for them to read — or shuffle the selection so they see different titles.
